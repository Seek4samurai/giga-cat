# Nyan Cat Game

Nyan cat game is actually a music rhythm based game üé∂ I.e you start with a decent difficulty as the music in start is decent and it expect you to pass through it, after a few tries at least. 
Once you pass through the first phase of the game, you'll enter a Panic event phase, where it gets real exciting üé∏. Panic event can start anytime above the score of `50 pts`.

# Why this?
After participating in 4 previous Hackathons (actually winning non of them :P), I decided to do something really entertaining & crazy. So I came up with this idea to make a web game using [Redis](https://app.redislabs.com/) as a primary database. Thanks to [RedisOm](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node) it got really easy to do this.
Easy to use thanks to the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/), it was a fun project to work on, and really think it's a Wacky Wildcard Project :P.

# Overview video üé•

Here's a short video that explains the project and how it uses Redis:

[![YouTube video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dCb1ebFYIs/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dCb1ebFYIs)

## How it works ü§î
When it comes to working of this game, it comes down to a web application. Here I've created a Next app using `npx create-next-app`. Metamask wallet address for user Authentication, this app uses Next.js framework with Moralis SDK and Redis for querying & storing data into Redis cloud.
Here game is rendered using HTML5 canvas.

### How the data is stored: ü§î

In this application, I've something called [Redis-om](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node) for Node.js.
Here data is stored in the form of JSON where following schema is created
```javascript
class Score extends Entity {}

const schema = new Schema(
  Score,
  {
    address: { type: "string" },
    score: { type: "number", sortable: true, textSearch: true },
  },
  { dataStructure: "JSON" }
);
```
```javascript
export const createScore = async (data) => {
  await connect();

  const repository = client?.fetchRepository(schema, client);

  const score = repository.createEntity();
  score.score = data.score;
  score.address = data.address;

  const id = await repository.save(score);

  const ttlInSeconds = 21600;
  await repository.expire(id, ttlInSeconds);

  await client.close();
  return id;
};
```
Notice I've also declared something as `const ttlInSeconds = 21600;` and then used it in `  await repository.expire(id, ttlInSeconds);` because we don't want to store any data longer than 6 hours. Yes, your scores will reset after 6 hours.
Once this is done, we can create an API route in our Next.js application.
```javascript
import { createScore } from "../../lib/redis";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const id = await createScore(req.body);
  res.status(200).json({ id });
}
```
Once we create it in our database, it will be stored in our database by giving data from our frontend, I've used javascript's `fetch` API for this purpose. You can [check this file](https://github.com/Seek4samurai/project-giga-cat/blob/main/lib/redis.js), where I've declared such logic.

### How the data is accessed: ü§î

Now if you've gone through the application, there is a section of leaderboard, where we have `scores` and `addresses` of players with highest pts.
To access our database and then fetch it from our Redis database, we have couple of ways like...

In our development phase, I've used `Redis Insight`, importing my database using `public endpoint` & `password`.

But in our application I've used `.env.local` file to store all API keys.
Once that is done, in our `redis.js` file we create a redis instance also called `Client()` like:
```javascript
import { Client } from "redis-om";

const client = new Client();

const connect = async () => {
  if (!client.isOpen()) {
    await client.open(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIS_URL);
  }
};
```
Now once this is setup, we use `fetch` API to query for data.
```javascript
  const fetchScores = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/search?" + query);
    const results = await res.json();
    return results["scores"];
  };
```
To do this, we also need to create an index using `await repository.createIndex();` and then we can create another API route to call this.
```javascript
import { createIndex } from "../../lib/redis";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  await createIndex();
  res.status(200).send("Index is created");
}
```
Then we use a custom function `searchScore()` to get the data of top-3 players with highest scores, we used `RediSearch` for that purpose.
```javascript
export const searchScore = async () => {
  await connect();

  const repository = client.fetchRepository(schema, client);

  const offset = 0;
  const count = 3;

  const scores = await repository
    .search()
    .sortDesc("score")
    .return.page(offset, count);

  return scores;
};
```
This will get us the data we want. And we can get that data using API route as `search.js`
```javascript
import { searchScore } from "../../lib/redis";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const data = req.query;
  const query = Object.keys(data)[0];
  // console.log(query);

  const scores = await searchScore(query);
  res.status(200).json({ scores });
}
```
You can [check this file](https://github.com/Seek4samurai/project-giga-cat/blob/main/lib/redis.js), where I've declared such logic.

One more thing is that we are also displaying the top-3 players in the Home page of the Game. Let's dig it...
So we're doing something similar to what we did above I.e.
```javascript
const fetchScores = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/search?" + query);
    const results = await res.json();
    return results["scores"];
};
```
Fetching score as an Object. Then in our separate `Marq.jsx` component we are using it as:
```javascript
{score[0]?.address?.slice(0, 9)}...{score[0]?.address?.slice(39)}
```

## How to run it locally? üíª

**Requirements** üìù
1. Node.js - Expected version ">=14.17.0". If you need help in installing on Linux like me [Check out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63312642/how-to-install-node-tar-xz-file-in-linux).
2. Yarn - 1.22.19 (I used).
3. Metamask installed on Browser - [Download here](https://metamask.io/)

**You'll need Metamask account to pass Authentication** üìù

![Demo-Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seek4samurai/project-giga-cat/main/public/demo/login.png)

Follow these steps to run on your device after `Cloning the repository` and `cd project-giga-cat` to enter the root project folder.

1. First things first, use `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
2. In root directory of the repo, create a file `.env.local` and declare 3 env variables. But before that go to [Moralis.io](https://moralis.io/) & [Redis](https://app.redislabs.com/) and create a free account over both.
3. In Moralis dashboard, click on `Create new Dapp` and select the Environment `Testnet` and under testnets select `ETH Goerli` testnet. Select a region and give a cute name, finally proceed with it.
4. Now, create a subscription in your `Redis Cloud` and then create a database for yourself. Make sure to save their details.
5. In your `.env.local`, create 3 variables as: 
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_SERVER_URL`
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_APP_ID`
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIS_URL`
and give them their values.
6. For Moralis, go to settings of your Dapp, and copy the `Dapp URL` for `SERVER_URL` & `Application ID` for `APP_ID`.
7. For Redis, go to your database and from `Security` section copy the `user password`, and also take the `public endpoint` from `General` section. Now paste them in the `.env.local` file, formatted as `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@endpoint:port`. Note: port should be appended at the last of your `public endpoint`.
8. Now run `yarn run dev` to run the application.
9. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you'll see the `Connect Wallet` page.
10. Click on `Connect wallet` and for signing in, Metamask should've popped up. And you'll enter the dashboard.
